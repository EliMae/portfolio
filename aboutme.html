<p>I am a 17 year old from the small city of Santa Rosa, California. I have three brother one older and two younger. I love photography and film editing however i mostly enjoy watching video or movies on Youtube and Netflix. I do not like heights or sea food. One fun fact about me is that I dress up for halloween every year as a zombie or some other scary character.</p>
